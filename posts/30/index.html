<p>F-RTO：Forward RTO-Recovery，for a TCP sender to recover after a retransmission timeout.
F-RTO的主要目的：The main motivation of the algorithm is to recover efficiently from a spurious
RTO.</p>

<h4>F-RTO的基本思想</h4>

<p>The guideline behind F-RTO is, that an RTO either indicates a loss, or it is caused by an
excessive delay in packet delivery while there still are outstanding segments in flight. If the
RTO was due to delay, i.e. the RTO was spurious, acknowledgements for non-retransmitted
segments sent before the RTO should arrive at the sender after the RTO occurred. If no such
segments arrive, the RTO is concluded to be non-spurious and the conventional RTO
recovery with go-back-N retransmissions should take place at the TCP sender.</p>

<p>To implement the principle described above, an F-RTO sender acts as follows: if the first ACK
arriving after a RTO-triggered retransmission advances the window, transmit two new segments
instead of continuing retransmissions. If also the second incoming acknowledgement advances
the window, RTO is likely to be spurious, because the second ACK is triggered by an originally
transmitted segment that has not been retransmitted after the RTO. If either one of the two
acknowledgements after RTO is a duplicate ACK, the sender continues retransmissions similarly
to the conventional RTO recovery algorithm.</p>

<p>When the retransmission timer expires, the F-RTO algorithm takes the following steps at the TCP
sender. In the algorithm description below we use SND.UNA to indicate the first unacknowledged
segment.</p>

<p>1.When the retransmission timer expires, retransmit the segment that triggered the timeout. As
required by the TCP congestion control specifications, the ssthresh is adjusted to half of the
number of currently outstanding segments. However, the congestion window is not yet set to one
segment, but the sender waits for the next two acknowledgements before deciding on what to do
with the congestion window.</p>

<p>2.When the first acknowledgement after RTO arrives at the sender, the sender chooses the
following actions depending on whether the ACK advances the window or whether it is a duplicate
ACK.</p>

<p>（a）If the acknowledgement advances SND.UNA, transmit up to two new (previously unsent)
segments. This is the main point in which the F-RTO algorithm differs from the conventional way
of recovering from RTO. After transmitting the two new segments, the congestion window size
is set to have the same value as ssthresh. In effect this reduces the transmission rate of the
sender to half of the transmission rate before the RTO. At this point the TCP sender has transmitted
a total of three segments after the RTO, similarly to the conventional recovery algorithm. If
transmitting two new segments is not possible due to advertised window limitation, or because
there is no more data to send, the sender may transmit only one segment. If now new data can
be transmitted, the TCP sender follows the conventional RTO recovery algorithm and starts
retransmitting the unacknowledged data using slow start.</p>

<p>（b）If the acknowledgement is duplicate ACK, set the congestion window to one segment and
proceed with the conventional RTO recovery. Two new segments are not transmitted in this case,
because the conventional RTO recovery algorithm would not transmit anything at this point either.
Instead, the F-RTO sender continues with slow start and performs similarly to the conventional
TCP sender in retransmitting the unacknowledged segments. Step 3 of the F-RTO algorithm is
not entered in this case. A common reason for executing this branch is the loss of a segment,
in which case the segments injected by the sender before the RTO may still trigger duplicate
ACKs that arrive at the sender after the RTO.</p>

<p>3.When the second acknowledgement after the RTO arrives, either continue transmitting new
data, or start retransmitting with the slow start algorithm, depending on whether new data was
acknowledged.</p>

<p>（a）If the acknowledgement advances SND.UNA, continue transmitting new data following
the congestion avoidance algorithm. Because the TCP sender has retransmitted only one
segment after the RTO, this acknowledgement indicates that an originally transmitted
segment has arrived at the receiver. This is regarded as a strong indication of a suprious
RTO. However, since the TCP sender cannot surely know at this point whether the segment
that triggered the RTO was actually lost, adjusting the congestion control parameters after
the RTO is the conservative action. From this point on, the TCP sender continues as in the
normal congestion avoidance.</p>

<p>If this algorithm branch is taken, the TCP sender ignores the send_high variable that indicates
the highest sequence number transmitted so far. The send_high variable was proposed as a
bugfix for avoiding unnecessary multiple fast retransmits when RTO expires during fast recovery
with NewReon TCP. As the sender has not retransmitted other segments but the one that
triggered RTO, the problem addressed by the bugfix cannot occur. Therefore, if there are
duplicate ACKs arriving at the sender after the RTO, they are likely to indicate a packet loss,
hence fast retransmit should bu used to allow efficient recovery. Alternatively, if there are not
enough duplicate ACKs arriving at the sender after a packet loss, the retransmission timer
expires another time and the sender enters step 1 of this algorithm to detect whether the
new RTO is spurious.</p>

<p>（b）If the acknowledgement is duplicate ACK, set the congestion window to three segments,
continue with the slow start algorithm retransmitting unacknowledged segments. The duplicate
ACK indicates that at least one segment other than the segment that triggered RTO is lost in the
last window of data. There is no sufficient evidence that any of the segments was delayed.
Therefore the sender proceeds with retransmissions similarly to the conventional RTO recovery
algorithm, with the send_high variable stored when the retransmission timer expired to avoid
unnecessary fast retransmits.</p>

<h4>引起RTO的主要因素：</h4>

<p>（1）Sudden delays<br/>
The primary motivation of the F-RTO algorithm is to improve the TCP performance when sudden
delays cause spurious retransmission timeouts.</p>

<p>（2）Packet losses<br/>
These timeouts occur mainly when retransmissions are lost, since lost original packets are
usually recovered by fast retransmit.</p>

<p>（3）Bursty losses<br/>
Losses of several successive packets can result in a retransmission timeout.</p>

<h5>造成虚假RTO的原因还有：</h5>

<p>Wireless links may also suffer from link outages that cause persistent data loss for a period
of time.<br/>
Oher potential reasons for sudden delays that have been reported to trigger spurious RTOs
include a delay due to tedious actions required to complete a hand-off or re-routing of packets
to the new serving access point after the hand-off, arrival of competing traffic on a shared link
with low bandwidth, and a sudden bandwidth degradation due to reduced resources on a
wireless channel.</p>

<h5>造成真实RTO的原因：</h5>

<p>A RTO-triggered retransmission is needed when a retransmission is lost, or when nearly a whole
window of data is lost, thus making it impossible for the receiver to generate enough duplicate
ACKs for triggering TCP fast retransmit.</p>

<h4>虚假RTO的后果</h4>

<p>If no segments were lost but the retransmission timer expires spuriously, the segments retransmitted
in the slow-start are sent unnecessarily. Particularly, this phenomenon is very possible with the
various wireless access network technologies that are prone to sudden delay spikes.
The retransmission timer expires because of the delay, spuriously triggering the RTO recovery and
unnecessarily retransmission of all unacknowledged segments. This happens because after the
delay the ACKs for the original segments arrive at the sender one at the time but too late, because
the TCP sender has already entered the RTO recovery. Therefore, each of the ACKs trigger the
retransmission of segments for which the original ACKs will arrive after a while. This continues
until the whole window of segments is eventually unnecessarily retransmitted. Furthermore,
because a full window of retransmitted segments arrive unnecessarily at the receiver, it generates
duplicate ACKs for these out-of-order segments. Later on, the duplicate ACKs unnecessarily
trigger fast retransmit at the sender.</p>

<p>TCP uses the fast retransmit mechanism to trigger retransmissions after receiving three successive
duplicate acknowledgements (ACKs). If for a certain time period TCP sender does not receive ACKs
that acknowledge new data, the TCP retransmission timer expires as a backoff mechanism.
When the retransmission time expires, the TCP sender retransmits the first unacknowledged
segment assuming it was lost in the network. Because a retransmission timeout (RTO) can be
an indication of severe congestion in the network, the TCP sender resets its congestion window
to one segment and starts increasing it according to the slow start algorithm.
However, if the RTO occurs spuriously and there still are segments outstanding in the network,
a false slow start is harmful for the potentially congested network as it injects extra segments
to the network at increasing rate.</p>

<p>虚假的RTO不仅会降低吞吐量，而且由于丢包后会使用慢启动算法，快速的向网络中注入数据包，
而此时网络中还有原来发送的数据包，这样可能会造成真正的网络拥塞！</p>

<p>How about Reliable link-layer protocol ?
Since wireless networks are often subject to high packet loss rate due to corruption or hand-offs,
reliable link-layer protocols are widely employed with wireless links. The link-layer receiver often
aims to deliver the packets to the upper protocol layers in order, which implies that the later
arriving packets are blocked until the head of the queue arrives successfully. Due to the strict
link-layer ordering, the communication end point observe a pause in packet delivery that can
cause a spurious TCP RTO instead of getting out-of-order packets that could result in a false
fast retransmit instead. Either way, interaction between TCP retransmission mechanisms
and link-layer recovery can cause poor performance.</p>

<p>DSACK不能解决此问题
If the unnecessary retransmissions occurred due to spurious RTO caused by a sudden delay,
the acknowledgements with the DSACK information arrive at the sender only after the
acknowledgements of the original segments. Therefore, the unnecessary retransmissions
following the spurious RTO cannot be avoided by using DSACK. Instead, the suggested
recovery algorithm using DSACK can only revert the congestion control parameters to the
state preceding the spurious retransmissions.</p>

<h4>F-RTO实现</h4>

<p>F-RTO is implemented (mainly) in four functions:<br/>
（1）tcp_use_frto() is used to determine if TCP can use F-RTO.</p>

<p>（2）tcp_enter_frto() prepares TCP state on RTO if F-RTO is used, it is called when tcp_use_frto() showed green light.</p>

<p>（3）tcp_process_frto() handles incoming ACKs during F-RTO algorithm.</p>

<p>（4）tcp_enter_frto_loss() is called if there is not enough evidence to prove that the RTO is indeed spurious. It transfers the control from F-RTO to the conventional RTO recovery.</p>

<h4>判断是否可以使用F-RTO</h4>

<p> 调用时机：当TCP段传送超时后，会引起段的重传，在重传定时器的处理过程中会判断是否可以使用F-RTO算法。</p>

<h4>F-RTO算法处理</h4>

<p>F-RTO算法的处理过程主要发生在重传完超时数据包后。发送方在接收到ACK后，在处理ACK时会检查是否处于F-RTO处理阶段。如果是则会调用tcp_process_frto()进行F-RTO阶段的处理。</p>

<h4>3.2.12的F-RTO</h4>

<p>F-RTO spurious RTO detection algorithm (RFC4138)<br/>
F-RTO affects during two new ACKs following RTO (well, almost, see inline
comments). State (ACK number) is kept in frto_counter. When ACK advances
window (but not to or beyond highest sequence sent before RTO) :<br/>
On First ACK, send two new segments out.<br/>
On second ACK, RTO was likely spurious. Do spurious response (response<br/>
  algorithm is not part of the F-RTO detection algorithm given in RFC4138 but<br/>
  can be selected separately).</p>

<p>Otherwise (basically on duplicate ACK), RTO was (likely) caused by a loss and
TCP falls back to conventional RTO recovery. F-RTO allows overriding of Nagle,
this is done using frto_counter states 2 and 3, when a new data segment of any
size sent during F-RTO, state 2 is upgraded to 3.</p>

<p>Rationale: if the RTO was suprious, new ACKs should arrive from the original
window even after we transmit two new data segments.</p>

<p>SACK version:<br/>
  on first step, wait until first cumulative ACK arrives, then move to the second
  step. In second step, the next ACK decides.</p>

<h4>tcp_frto_response选项</h4>

<p>tcp_frto_response表示TCP在检测到虚假的RTO后，采用什么函数来进行阈值和拥塞窗口的调整，它有三种取值：</p>

<h5>（1）值为2</h5>

<p>表示使用tcp_undo_spur_to_response()，这是一种比较激进的处理方法，它把阈值和拥塞窗口都恢复到RTO前的值。</p>

<h5>（2）值为1</h5>

<p>表示使用tcp_conservative_spur_to_response()，这是一种很保守的处理方法。<br/>
假设减小因子为B，RTO前的窗口为C，那么一般情况下（因为阈值调整算法不同）<br/>
此后ssthresh=（1 - B）C，cwnd = （1 -B ）（1- B）C</p>

<h5>（3）值为0或其它（默认为0）</h5>

<p>表示使用默认的tcp_ratehalving_spur_to_response()，也是一种保守的处理方法。</p>

<h3>TCP拥塞状态机的实现（上）</h3>

<p>内容：本文主要分析TCP拥塞状态机的实现中，主体函数tcp_fastretrans_alert()的实现。接下来的文章会对其中重要的部分进行更具体的分析。</p>

<p>内核版本：2.6.37</p>

<h4>原理</h4>

<p>先来看一下涉及到的知识。</p>

<h5>拥塞状态：</h5>

<p>（1）Open：Normal state, no dubious events, fast path.<br/>
（2）Disorder：In all respects it is Open, but requres a bit more attention.<br/>
  It is entered when we see some SACKs or dupacks. It is split of Open mainly to move some processing from fast path to slow one.<br/>
（3）CWR：cwnd was reduced due to some Congestion Notification event.<br/>
  It can be ECN, ICMP source quench, local device congestion.<br/>
（4）Recovery：cwnd was reduced, we are fast-retransmitting.<br/>
（5）Loss：cwnd was reduced due to RTO timeout or SACK reneging.</p>

<h5>tcp_fastretrans_alert() is entered：</h5>

<p>（1）each incoming ACK, if state is not Open<br/>
（2）when arrived ACK is unusual, namely:<br/>
  SACK<br/>
  Duplicate ACK<br/>
  ECN ECE</p>

<h5>Counting packets in flight is pretty simple.</h5>

<p>（1）in_flight = packets_out - left_out + retrans_out<br/>
packets_out is SND.NXT - SND.UNA counted in packets. <br/>
retrans_out is number of retransmitted segments.<br/>
left_out is number of segments left network, but not ACKed yet.</p>

<p>（2）left_out = sacked_out + lost_out<br/>
sacked_out：Packets, which arrived to receiver out of order and hence not ACKed. With SACK this number is simply amount of SACKed data. Even without SACKs it is easy to give pretty reliable estimate of this number, counting duplicate ACKs.</p>

<p>（3）lost_out：Packets lost by network. TCP has no explicit loss notification feedback from network(for now). It means that this number can be only guessed. Actually, it is the heuristics to predict lossage that distinguishes different algorithms.<br/>
F.e. after RTO, when all the queue is considered as lost, lost_out = packets_out and in_flight = retrans_out.</p>

<h5>Essentially, we have now two algorithms counting lost packets.</h5>

<p>1）FACK：It is the simplest heuristics. As soon as we decided that something is lost, we decide that all not SACKed packets until the most forward SACK are lost. I.e.<br/>
lost_out = fackets_out - sacked_out and left_out = fackets_out<br/>
It is absolutely correct estimate, if network does not reorder packets. And it loses any connection to reality when reordering takes place. We use FACK by defaut until reordering is suspected on the path to this destination.</p>

<p>2）NewReno：when Recovery is entered, we assume that one segment is lost (classic Reno). While we are in Recovery and a partial ACK arrives, we assume that one more packet is lost (NewReno).<br/>
This heuristics are the same in NewReno and SACK. <br/>
Imagine, that&rsquo;s all! Forget about all this shamanism about CWND inflation deflation etc. CWND is real congestion window, never inflated, changes only according to classic VJ rules.</p>

<p>Really tricky (and requiring careful tuning) part of algorithm is hidden in functions tcp_time_to_recover() and tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue().</p>

<h5>tcp_time_to_recover()</h5>

<p>It determines the moment when we should reduce cwnd and, hence, slow down forward transmission. In fact, it determines the moment when we decide that hole is caused by loss, rather than by a reorder.</p>

<h5>tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()</h5>

<p>It decides what we should retransmit to fill holes, caused by lost packets.</p>

<h5>undo heuristics</h5>

<p>And the most logically complicated part of algorithm is undo heuristics. We detect false retransmits due to both too early fast retransmit (reordering) and underestimated RTO, analyzing timestamps and D-SACKs. When we detect that some segments were retransmitted by mistake and CWND reduction was wrong, we undo window reduction and abort recovery phase. This logic is hidden inside several functions named tcp_try_undo_<something>.</p>

<h4>主体函数</h4>

<p>TCP拥塞状态机主要是在tcp_fastretrans_alert()中实现的，tcp_fastretrans_alert()在tcp_ack()中被调用。</p>

<p>此函数分成几个阶段：<br/>
A. FLAG_ECE，收到包含ECE标志的ACK。<br/>
B. reneging SACKs，ACK指向已经被SACK的数据段。如果是此原因，进入超时处理，然后返回。<br/>
C. state is not Open，发现丢包，需要标志出丢失的包，这样就知道该重传哪些包了。<br/>
D. 检查是否有错误( left_out > packets_out)。<br/>
E. 各个状态是怎样退出的，当snd_una >= high_seq时候。<br/>
F. 各个状态的处理和进入。</p>

<p>下文会围绕这几个阶段进行具体分析。</p>

<p>（1）如果启用了FACK，那么fackets_out = left_out<br/>
  fackets_out = sacked_out + loss_out<br/>
  所以：loss_out = fackets_out - sacked_out<br/>
  这是一种比较激进的丢包估算，即FACK。</p>

<p>（2）如果没启用FACK，那么就假设只丢了一个数据包，所以left_out = sacked_out + 1<br/>
  这是一种较为保守的做法，当出现大量丢包时，这种做法会出现问题。</p>

<h3>TCP拥塞状态机的实现（中）</h3>

<p>内容：本文主要分析TCP拥塞状态机的实现中，虚假SACK的处理、标志丢失数据包的详细过程。<br/>
内核版本：2.6.37</p>

<h4>虚假SACK</h4>

<p>state B</p>

<p>如果接收的ACK指向已记录的SACK，这说明记录的SACK并没有反应接收方的真实的状态，也就是说接收方现在已经处于严重拥塞的状态或者在处理上有bug，所以接下来就按照超时重传的方式去处理。因为按照正常的逻辑流程，接收的ACK不应该指向已记录的SACK，而应该指向SACK后面未接收的地方。通常情况下，此时接收方已经删除了保存到失序队列中的段。</p>

<h4>添加LOST标志</h4>

<p>state C</p>

<p>Q: 我们发现有数据包丢失了，怎么知道要重传哪些数据包呢？<br/>
A: tcp_mark_head_lost()通过给丢失的数据包标志TCPCB_LOST，就可以表明哪些数据包需要重传。<br/>
如果通过SACK发现有段丢失，则需要从重传队首或上次标志丢失段的位置开始，为记分牌为0的段添加LOST标志，直到所有被标志LOST的段数达到packets或者被标志序号超过high_seq为止。</p>

<h3>TCP拥塞状态机的实现（下）</h3>

<p>内容：本文主要分析TCP拥塞状态机的实现中，各个拥塞状态的进入、处理和退出的详细过程。<br/>
内核版本：2.6.37</p>

<h4>各状态的退出</h4>

<p>state E</p>

<p>各状态的退出时机：tp->snd_una >= tp->high_seq</p>

<h5>（1） Open</h5>

<p>因为Open态是正常态，所以无所谓退出，保持原样。</p>

<h5>（2）Loss</h5>

<p>icsk->icsk_retransmits = 0; /<em>超时重传次数归0</em>/<br/>
tcp_try_undo_recovery(sk);</p>

<p>检查是否需要undo，不管undo成功与否，都返回Open态。</p>

<h5>（3）CWR</h5>

<p>If seq number greater than high_seq is acked, it indicates that the CWR indication has reached the peer TCP, call tcp_complete_cwr() to bring down the cwnd to ssthresh value.</p>

<p>tcp_complete_cwr(sk)中：<br/>
tp->snd_cwnd = min(tp->snd_cwnd, tp->snd_ssthresh);</p>

<h5>（4）Disorder</h5>

<p>启用sack，则tcp_try_undo_dsack(sk)，交给它处理。否则，tp->undo_marker = 0;</p>

<h5>（5）Recovery</h5>

<p>tcp_try_undo_recovery(sk);<br/>
在tcp_complete_cwr(sk)中：<br/>
tp->snd_cwnd = tp->snd_ssthresh;</p>

<h4>Recovery状态处理</h4>

<p>state F</p>

<h5>（1）收到dupack</h5>

<p>如果收到的ACK并没有使snd_una前进、是重复的ACK，并且没有使用SACK，则：<br/>
    sacked_out++，增加sacked数据包的个数。<br/>
    检查是否有reordering，如果有reordering则：<br/>
        纠正sacked_out<br/>
        禁用FACK(画外音：这实际上是多此一举，没有使用SACK，哪来的FACK？)<br/>
        更新tp->reordering</p>

<h5>（2）收到partical ack</h5>

<p>do_lost = tcp_try_undo_partical(sk, pkts_acked);<br/>
一般情况下do_lost都会为真，除非需要undo。<br/>
具体可以看前面blog《TCP拥塞窗口调整撤销剖析》。</p>

<h5>（3）跳出F state，标志丢失的数据段</h5>

<p>执行完(1)或(2)后，就跳出F state。<br/>
如果有丢失的数据包，或者发送队列的第一个数据包超时，则调用tcp_update_scoreboard()来更新记分牌，给丢失的段加TCPCB_LOST标志，增加lost_out。</p>

<p>检查发送队列的第一个数据包是否超时。</p>

<p>为确定丢失的段更新记分牌，记分牌指的是tcp_skb_cb结构中的sacked，保存该数据包的状态信息。<br/>
(1) 没有使用SACK，每次收到dupack或partical ack时，只能标志一个包为丢失。</p>

<p>(2) 使用FACK，每次收到dupack或partical ack时，分两种情况：<br/>
  如果lost = fackets_out - reordering &lt;= 0，这时虽然不能排除是由乱序引起的，但是fack的思想较为激进，所以也标志一个包为丢失。<br/>
  如果lost >0，就可以肯定有丢包，一次性可以标志lost个包为丢失。</p>

<p>(3) 使用SACK，但是没有使用FACK。<br/>
  如果sacked_upto = sacked_out - reordering，这是不能排除是由乱序引起的，除非快速重传标志fast_rexmit为真，才标志一个包为丢失。<br/>
  如果sacked_upto > 0，就可以肯定有丢包，一次性可以标志sacked_upto个包为丢失。</p>

<p>内核默认使用的是(2)。</p>

<p>This function examines various parameters (like number of packet lost) for TCP connection to decide whether it is the right time to move to Recovery state. It&rsquo;s time to recover when TCP heuristics suggest a strong possibility of packet loss in the network, the following checks are made.</p>

<p>总的来说，一旦确定有丢包，或者很可能丢包，就可以进入Recovery状态恢复丢包了。</p>

<p>可以进入Recovery状态的条件包括：<br/>
(1) some packets are lost (lost_out is non zero)。发现有丢包。</p>

<p>(2) SACK is an acknowledgement for out of order packets. If number of packets Sacked is greater than the<br/>
  reordering metrics of the network, then loss is assumed to have happened.<br/>
  被fack数据或收到的重复ACK，大于乱序的阈值，表明很可能发生丢包。</p>

<p>(3) If the first packet waiting to be acked (head of the write Queue) has waited for time equivalent to retransmission<br/>
  timeout, the packet is assumed to have been lost. 发送队列的第一个数据段超时，表明它可能丢失了。</p>

<p>(4) If the following three conditions are true, TCP sender is in a state where no more data can be transmitted<br/>
  and number of packets acked is big enough to assume that rest of the packets are lost in the network:<br/>
  A: If packets in flight is less than the reordering metrics.<br/>
  B: More than half of the packets in flight have been sacked by the receiver or number of packets sacked is more<br/>
   than the Fast Retransmit thresh. (Fast Retransmit thresh is the number of dupacks that sender awaits before<br/>
   fast retransmission)<br/>
  C: The sender can not send any more packets because either it is bound by the sliding window or the application<br/>
   has not delivered any more data to it in anticipation of ACK for already provided data.<br/>
  我们收到很多的重复ACK，那么很可能有数据段丢失了。如果此时由于接收窗口或应用程序的限制而不能发送数据，那么我们不打算再等下去，直接进入Recovery状态。</p>

<p>(5) 当检测到当前流量很小时（packets_out &lt; 4），如果还满足以下条件：<br/>
  A: tp->thin_dupack == 1 /<em> Fast retransmit on first dupack </em>/<br/>
   或者sysctl_tcp_thin_dupack为1，表明允许在收到第一个重复的包时就重传。<br/>
  B: 启用SACK，且FACK或SACK的数据量大于1。<br/>
  C: 没有未发送的数据，tcp_send_head(sk) == NULL。<br/>
   这是一种特殊的情况，只有当流量非常小的时候才采用。</p>

<p>（7）刚进入Recovery时的设置<br/>
保存那些用于undo的数据：<br/>
tp->prior_ssthresh = tp->snd_ssthresh; /<em> 保存旧阈值</em>/<br/>
tp->undo_marker = tp->snd_una; /<em> tracking retrans started here.</em>/<br/>
tp->undo_retrans = tp->retrans_out; /<em> Retransmitted packets out </em>/</p>

<p>保存退出点：<br/>
tp->high_seq = tp->snd_nxt;</p>

<p>重置变量：<br/>
tp->snd_ssthresh = icsk->icsk_ca_ops->ssthresh(sk);<br/>
tp->bytes_acked = 0;<br/>
tp->snd_cwnd_cnt = 0;</p>

<p>进入Recovery状态：<br/>
tcp_set_ca_state(sk, TCP_CA_Recovery);</p>

<h4>Loss状态处理</h4>

<p>state F</p>

<h5>（1）收到partical ack</h5>

<p>icsk->icsk_retransmits = 0; /<em> 超时重传的次数归零</em>/<br/>
如果使用的是reno，没有使用sack，则归零tp->sacked_out。</p>

<h5>（2）尝试undo</h5>

<p>调用tcp_try_undo_loss()，当使用时间戳检测到一个不必要的重传时：<br/>
  移除记分牌中所有段的Loss标志，从而发送新的数据而不再重传。<br/>
  调用tcp_undo_cwr()来撤销拥塞窗口和阈值的调整。</p>

<p>否则：<br/>
  tcp_moderate_cwnd()调整拥塞窗口，防止爆发式重传。<br/>
  tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()继续重传丢失的数据段。</p>

<h4>其它状态处理</h4>

<p>state F</p>

<p>如果tcp_time_to_recover(sk)返回值为假，也就是说不能进入Recovery状态，则进行CWR、Disorder或Open状态的处理。</p>

<h5>（1）CWR状态</h5>

<p>Q: 什么时候进入CWR状态？<br/>
A: 如果检测到ACK包含ECE标志，表示接收方通知发送法进行显示拥塞控制。</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'> if (flag & FLAG_ECE)
</span><span class='line'>&#9; tcp_enter_cwr(sk, 1);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>tcp_enter_cwr()函数分析可见前面blog《TCP拥塞状态变迁》。<br/>
它主要做了：<br/>
  1. 重新设置慢启动阈值。<br/>
  2. 清除undo需要的标志，不允许undo。<br/>
  3. 记录此时的最高序号(high_seq = snd_nxt)，用于判断退出时机。<br/>
  4. 添加CWR标志，用于通知接收方它已经做出反应。<br/>
  5. 设置此时的状态为TCP_CA_CWR。</p>

<p>Q: 在CWR期间采取什么措施？<br/>
A: 拥塞窗口每隔一个确认段减小一个段，即每收到2个确认将拥塞窗口减1，直到拥塞窗口等于慢启动阈值为止。<br/>
   调用tcp_cwnd_down()。</p>

<h5>（2）Disorder状态</h5>

<p>Q: 什么时候进入Disorder状态？<br/>
A: 如果检测到有被sacked的数据包，或者有重传的数据包，则进入Disorder状态。<br/>
  当然，之前已经确认不能进入Loss或Recovery状态了。<br/>
  判断条件： sacked_out、lost_out、retrans_out、undo_marker不为0。</p>

<p>Q: 在Disorder期间采取什么措施？<br/>
A: 1. 设置CA状态为TCP_CA_Disorder。<br/>
   2. 记录此时的最高序号(high_seq = snd_nxt)，用于判断退出时机。<br/>
   3. 微调拥塞窗口，防止爆发式传输。</p>

<p>In Disorder state TCP is still unsure of genuiness of loss, after receiving acks with sack there may be a clearing ack which acks many packets non dubiously in one go. Such a clearing ack may cause a packet burst in the network, to avoid this cwnd size is reduced to allow no more than max_burst (usually 3) number of packets.</p>

<h5>（3）Open状态</h5>

<p>因为Open状态是正常的状态，是状态处理的最终目的，所以不需要进行额外处理。</p>

<h4>引言</h4>

<p>TCP中有拥塞控制，也有流控制，它们各自有什么作用呢？</p>

<p>拥塞控制(Congestion Control) — A mechanism to prevent a TCP sender from overwhelming the network.<br/>
流控制(Flow Control) — A mechanism to prevent a TCP sender from overwhelming a TCP receiver.</p>

<p>下面是一段关于流控制原理的简要描述。<br/>
“The basic flow control algorithm works as follows: The receiver communicates to the sender the maximum amount of data it can accept using the rwnd protocol field. This is called the receive window. The TCP sender then sends no more than this amount of data across the network. The TCP sender then stops and waits for acknowledgements back from the receiver. When acknowledgement of the previously sent data is returned to the sender, the sender then resumes sending new data. It&rsquo;s essentially the old maxim hurry up and wait. ”</p>

<p>由于发送速度可能大于接收速度、接收端的应用程序未能及时从接收缓冲区读取数据、接收缓冲区不够大不能缓存所有接收到的报文等原因，TCP接收端的接收缓冲区很快就会被塞满，从而导致不能接收后续的数据，发送端此后发送数据是无效的，因此需要流控制。TCP流控制主要用于匹配发送端和接收端的速度，即根据接收端当前的接收能力来调整发送端的发送速度。</p>

<p>TCP流控制中一个很重要的地方就是，TCP接收缓存大小是如何动态调整的，即TCP确认窗口上限是如何动态调整的？</p>

<p>本文主要分析TCP接收缓存大小动态调整的原理和实现。</p>

<h4>原理</h4>

<p>早期的TCP实现中，TCP接收缓存的大小是固定的。随着网络的发展，固定的TCP接收缓存值就不适应了，成为TCP性能的瓶颈之一。这时候就需要手动去调整，因为不同的网络需要不同大小的TCP接收缓存，手动调整不仅费时费力，还会引起一些问题。TCP接收缓存设置小了，就不能充分利用网络。而TCP缓存设置大了，又浪费了内存。</p>

<p>如果把TCP接收缓存设置为无穷大，那就更糟糕了，因为某些应用可能会耗尽内存，使其它应用的连接陷入饥饿。所以TCP接收缓存的大小需要动态调整，才能达到最佳的效果。</p>

<p>动态调整TCP接收缓存大小，就是使TCP接收缓存按需分配，同时要确保TCP接收缓存大小不会成为传输的限制。</p>

<p>linux采用Dynamic Right-Sizing方法来动态调整TCP的接收缓存大小，其基本思想就是：通过估算发送方的拥塞窗口的大小，来动态设置TCP接收缓存的大小。</p>

<p>It has been demomstrated that this method can successfully grow the receiver&rsquo;s advertised window at a pace sufficient to avoid constraining the sender&rsquo;s throughput. As a result, systems can avoid the network performance problems that result from either the under-utilization or over-utilization of buffer space.</p>

<h4>实现</h4>

<p>下文代码基于3.2.12内核，主要源文件为：net/ipv4/tcp_input.c。</p>

<h4>RTT测量</h4>

<p>此函数在接收到带有负载的数据段时被调用。</p>

<p>此函数的原理：我们知道发送端不可能在一个RTT期间发送大于一个通告窗口的数据量。那么接收端可以把接收一个确认窗口的数据量(rcv_wnd)所用的时间作为RTT。接收端收到一个数据段，然后发送确认(确认号为rcv_nxt，通告窗口为rcv_wnd)，开始计时，RTT就是收到序号为rcv_nxt + rcv_wnd的数据段所用的时间。很显然，这种假设并不准确，测量所得的RTT会偏大一些。所以这种方法只有当没有采用时间戳选项时才使用，而内核默认是采用时间戳选项的(tcp_timestamps为1)。</p>

<p>下面是一段对此方法的评价：<br/>
If the sender is being throttled by the network, this estimate will be valid. However, if the sending application did not have any data to send, the measured time could be much larger than the actual round-trip time. Thus this measurement acts only as an upper-bound on the round-trip time.</p>

<p>虽然此种方法是默认方法，但是在流量小的时候，通过时间戳采样得到的RTT的值会偏大，此时就会采用没有时间戳时的RTT测量方法。</p>

<h5>（3）采样处理</h5>

<p>不管是没有使用时间戳选项的RTT采样，还是使用时间戳选项的RTT采样，都是获得一个RTT样本。之后还需要对获得的RTT样本进行处理，以得到最终的RTT。</p>

<p>对于没有使用时间戳选项的RTT测量方法，不进行微调。因为用此种方法获得的RTT采样值已经偏高而且收敛很慢。直接选择最小RTT样本作为最终的RTT测量值。<br/>
对于使用时间戳选项的RTT测量方法，进行微调，新样本占最终RTT的1/8，即rtt = 7/8 old + 1/8 new。</p>

<h4>调整接收缓存</h4>

<p>当数据从TCP接收缓存复制到用户空间之后，会调用tcp_rcv_space_adjust()来调整TCP接收缓存和接收窗口上限的大小。</p>

<h6>（1）为什么是2倍呢？</h6>

<p>In order to keep pace with the growth of the sender&rsquo;s congestion window during slow-start, the receiver should use the same doubling factor. Thus the receiver should advertise a window that is twice the size of the last measured window size.</p>

<p>这样就能保证接收窗口上限的增长速度不小于拥塞窗口的增长速度，避免接收窗口成为传输瓶颈。</p>

<h6>（2）收到乱序包时有什么影响？</h6>

<p>Packets that are received out of order may have lowered the goodput during this measurement, but will increase the goodput of the following measurement which, if larger, will supercede this measurement.</p>

<p>乱序包会使本次的吞吐量测量值偏小，使下次的吞吐量测量值偏大。</p>

<h4>概述</h4>

<p>In computer networking, large segment offload (LSO) is a technique for increasing outbound
throughput of high-bandwidth network connections by reducing CPU overhead. It works by queuing
up large buffers and letting the network interface card (NIC) split them into separate packets.
The technique is also called TCP segmentation offload (TSO) when applied to TCP, or generic
segmentation offload (GSO).</p>

<p>The inbound counterpart of large segment offload is large recive offload (LRO).</p>

<p>When large chunks of data are to be sent over a computer network, they need to be first broken
down to smaller segments that can pass through all the network elements like routers and
switches between the source and destination computers. This process it referred to as
segmentation. Segmentation is often done by the TCP protocol in the host computer. Offloading
this work to the NIC is called TCP segmentation offload (TSO).</p>

<p>For example, a unit of 64KB (65,536 bytes) of data is usually segmented to 46 segments of 1448
bytes each before it is sent over the network through the NIC. With some intelligence in the NIC,
the host CPU can hand over the 64KB of data to the NIC in a single transmit request, the NIC can
break that data down into smaller segments of 1448 bytes, add the TCP, IP, and data link layer
protocol headers——according to a template provided by the host&rsquo;s TCP/IP stack——to each
segment, and send the resulting frames over the network. This significantly reduces the work
done by the CPU. Many new NICs on the market today support TSO. [1]</p>

<h4>具体</h4>

<p>It is a method to reduce CPU workload of packet cutting in 1500byte and asking hardware to
perform the same functionality.</p>

<p>1.TSO feature is implemented using the hardware support. This means hardware should be
able to segment the packets in max size of 1500 byte and reattach the header with every
packets.</p>

<p>2.Every network hardware is represented by netdevice structure in kernel. If hardware supports
TSO, it enables the Segmentation offload features in netdevice, mainly represented by
&ldquo; NETIF_F_TSO&rdquo; and other fields. [2]</p>

<p>TCP Segmentation Offload is supported in Linux by the network device layer. A driver that wants
to offer TSO needs to set the NETIF_F_TSO bit in the network device structure. In order for a
device to support TSO, it needs to also support Net : TCP Checksum Offloading and
Net : Scatter Gather.</p>

<p>The driver will then receive super-sized skb&rsquo;s. These are indicated to the driver by
skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size being non-zero. The gso_size is the size the hardware should
fragment the TCP data. TSO may change how and when TCP decides to send data. [3]</p>

<h4>TSO Nagle</h4>

<p>GSO, Generic Segmentation Offload，是协议栈提高效率的一个策略。</p>

<p>它尽可能晚的推迟分段(segmentation)，最理想的是在网卡驱动里分段，在网卡驱动里把
大包(super-packet)拆开，组成SG list，或在一块预先分配好的内存中重组各段，然后交给
网卡。</p>

<p>The idea behind GSO seems to be that many of the performance benefits of LSO (TSO/UFO)
can be obtained in a hardware-independent way, by passing large &ldquo;superpackets&rdquo; around for
as long as possible, and deferring segmentation to the last possible moment - for devices
without hardware segmentation/fragmentation support, this would be when data is actually
handled to the device driver; for devices with hardware support, it could even be done in hardware.</p>

<p>Try to defer sending, if possible, in order to minimize the amount of TSO splitting we do.
View it as a kind of TSO Nagle test.</p>

<p>通过延迟数据包的发送，来减少TSO分段的次数，达到减小CPU负载的目的。</p>

(2) 发送方不处于Open拥塞状态。处于异常状态时，不宜延迟。<br/>
(3) 上一次skb被延迟了，且距离现在大于等于2ms。延迟不能超过2ms。<br/>
(4) min(send_win, cong_win) > full-sized TSO skb。允许发送的数据量超过TSO一次能处理的最大值，没必要再defer。<br/>
(5) skb处于发送队列中间，且允许整个skb一起发送。处于发送队列中间的skb不能再获得新的数据，没必要再defer。<br/>
(6) tcp_tso_win_divisor有设置时，limit > 单个TSO段可消耗的数据量，即min(snd_wnd, snd_cwnd * mss_cache) / tcp_tso_win_divisor。<br/>
(7) tcp_tso_win_divisor没有设置时，limit > tcp_max_burst(tp) * mss_cache，一般是3个数据包。</p>

<p>条件4、5、6/7，都是limit > 某个阈值，就可以马上发送。这个因为通过这几个条件，可以确定此时发送是受到应用程序的限制，而不是通告窗口或者拥塞窗口。在应用程序发送的数据量很少的情况下，不宜采用TSO Nagle，因为这会影响此类应用。</p>

<p>我们注意到tcp_is_cwnd_limited()中的注释说：<br/>
&ldquo; This is the inverse of cwnd check in tcp_tso_should_defer"，所以可以认为在tcp_tso_should_defer()中包含判断
tcp_is_not_cwnd_limited (或者tcp_is_application_limited) 的条件。</p>

<h5>符合以下所有条件，才会进行TSO延迟：</h5>

<p>(1) 数据包不带有FIN标志。<br/>
(2) 发送方处于Open拥塞状态。<br/>
(3) 距离上一次延迟的时间在2ms以内。<br/>
(4) 允许发送的数据量小于sk_gso_max_size。<br/>
(5) skb处于发送队列末尾，或者skb不能整个发送出去。<br/>
(6) tcp_tso_win_divisor有设置时，允许发送的数据量不大于单个TSO段可消耗的。<br/>
(7) tcp_tso_win_divisor没有设置时，允许发送的数据量不大于3个包。</p>

<p>可以看到TSO的触发条件并不苛刻，所以被调用时并没有加unlikely。</p>

<h4>应用</h4>

<h5>(1) 禁用TSO</h5>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ethtool -K ethX tso off</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h5>(2) 启用TSO</h5>

<p>TSO是默认启用的。</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ethtool -K ethX tso on</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>TSO是通过网络设备进行TCP段的分割，从而来提高网络性能的一种技术。较大的数据包（超过标准1518B的帧）可以使用该技术，使操作系统减少必须处理的数据数量以提高性能。通常，当请求大量数据时，TCP发送方必须将数据拆分为MSS大小的数据块，然后进一步将其封装为数据包形式，以便最终可以在网络中进行传输。而当启用了TSO技术之后，TCP发送方可以将数据拆分为MSS整数倍大小的数据块，然后将大块数据的分段直接交给网络设备处理，操作系统需要创建并传输的数据包数量更少，因此性能会有较大的提高。图1-3所示为标准帧和TSO技术特性比较。</p>

<p><img src="/images/kernel/2015-03-19-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p> 图是标准帧和TSO的处理过程<br/>
a) 不支持TSO  b) 启用TSO后</p>

<p>从前面有关TSO的论述可以看出，TSO只是针对TCP协议的，使TCP协议在硬件上得到了有力的支持。事实上，这种概念也可以应用于其他的传输层协议，如TCPv6，UDP，甚至DCCP等，这就是GSO(Generic Segmentation Offload)。</p>

<p>性能提高的关键在于尽可能地推迟分段的时机，这样才能有效地降低成本。最理想的是在网络设备驱动里进行分段，在网络设备驱动里把大包进行拆分，组成分段列表，或在一块预先分配好的内存中重组各段，然后交给网络设备。这样，就要在网络设备的驱动里边来实现它，那么就需要修改每一个网络设备的驱动程序。事实上，这样做不大现实。</p>

<p>然而似乎有另一种更容易的解决办法来支持GSO，那就是在把数据报文提交给网络设备驱动之前进行聚合/分散操作。Linux目前支持GSO框架已经支持的传输层的其他协议。有关GSO方面的代码，参见后续章节。</p>

<p>应用层可以使用ethtool -K eth0 tso off|on命令对支持TSO特性的网络设备进行TSO功能的关闭和启用。</p>
